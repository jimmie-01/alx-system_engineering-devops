# SSH

## Learning Objectives
* We are expected at the end of this project to fully grasp the concept a server: 
* where servers live;
* what SSh is;
* How to create an SSH RSA key pair;
* How to connect to remote host using an SSh RSA key pair;
* Know the advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash instead of /bin/bash

## Tasks
0. Write a Bash script that uses ssh to connect to your server using the private key ~/.ssh/school with the user ubuntu.
	* Only use ssh single-character flags
	* You cannot use -l
	* You do not need to handle the case of a private key protected by a passphrase
1. Write a Bash script that creates an RSA key pair.
2. Your machine has an SSH configuration file for the local SSH client, letâ€™s configure it to our needs so that you can connect to a server without typing a password. Share your SSH client configuration in your answer file.
3. Add the SSH public key below to your server so that we can connect using the ubuntu user.
