# Web stack debugging 4

## Tasks

1. For the benchmarking, we are using ApacheBench which is a quite popular tool in the industry. It allows you to simulate HTTP requests to a web server. In this case, I will make 2000 requests to my server with 100 requests at a time. We can see that 943 requests failed, letâ€™s fix our stack so that we get to 0

2. Change the OS configuration so that it is possible to login with the holberton user and open a file without any error message.
